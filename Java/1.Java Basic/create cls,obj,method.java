Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create a class, object, method, and its signature in Python:

*Class*

A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and methods of an object.


class SmartVacuumCleaner:
    pass


*Object*

An object is an instance of a class. It has its own set of attributes (data) and methods (functions).

my_vacuum = SmartVacuumCleaner()


*Method*

A method is a function that belongs to a class. It operates on the data of the class and is used to perform operations.

```
class SmartVacuumCleaner:
    def clean(self):
        print("Vacuum cleaner is cleaning")


*Method Signature*

A method signature is the declaration of the method, including its name, parameters, and return type.


class SmartVacuumCleaner:
    def clean(self, speed: int, area: str) -> None:
        print(f"Vacuum cleaner is cleaning at speed {speed} in {area}")
